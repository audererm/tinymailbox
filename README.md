# tinymailbox

Access all your e-mail accounts from a tiny, lightweight REPL.

Currently only supports gmail.

## Installation

First, you'll need to create some files to store your account info.

    $ mkdir ~/.tinymailbox
    $ cd ~/.tinymailbox
    $ touch tmbrc

Then, open tmbrc in your favorite text editor and add your info in the following format:

    username: type_your_full_email_here
    password: type_your_password_here

For additional accounts, create more files in the ~/.tinymailbox directory with the name of your full email, and use the same format as above.

It's all really ugly right now but that will be changed!

## Usage

To run the mail repl, cd into the cloned folder, then run the following:

    $ cd src/tinymailbox
    $ lein run

This will start up the mail repl, and you should see your default email (defined in ~/.tinymailbox/tmbrc).

### REPL Commands

There are multiple commands you can use for each action. Use whichever you are more familiar with.

  Check inbox:

    > inbox
    > received

  Check outbox:

    > outbox
    > sent

  Check spam:

    > spam

  Mark all inbox messages as read:

    > readall

  Search your inbox:

    > search your_search_query
    > find you_search_query

  Switch to another account:

    > su new_account@gmail.com
    > switch new_account@gmail.com

  Exit the REPL:

    > exit
    > quit
    > bye
